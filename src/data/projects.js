        <p>
          Virtual garage for your vehicles created with <em>ReactJS</em>. Styled
          applied with Bootstrap and SCSS. CarWallet allows you to add your own,
          or your dream vehicles to the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          CarWallet is using <em>Firebase</em> to store uploaded images of your
          cars. State of cars list is saved in your local storage, so it
          persists when you leave the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can freely add, edit and remove vehicles from the list. State
          between components is shared thanks to <em>Context API.</em>

          Virtual garage for your vehicles created with <em>ReactJS</em>. Styled
          applied with Bootstrap and SCSS. CarWallet allows you to add your own,
          or your dream vehicles to the list.

          CarWallet is using <em>Firebase</em> to store uploaded images of your
          cars. State of cars list is saved in your local storage, so it
          persists when you leave the app.

          You can freely add, edit and remove vehicles from the list. State
          between components is shared thanks to <em>Context API.</em>
